This is a slightly modified version of https://github.com/esromerog/LSLWebsocketMirror
TODO: Bring this into a proper format where it can be pushed/commited

Issues with YQ/Websocket Streamer:

- crashes (?) for null samples. Fixed by doing samples = list(np.nan_to_num(np.array(samples))) in lslmirror.py
- doesnt work for irregular srates (fixed, changed a few files)
- crashes when streams lose connection (fixed by simply wrapping around try/catch)


Minor issues:

- code<->visual slider dragging is bugged in firefox
- when lsl stream connection is lost and re-gained, they have to be completely reassigned (in data mapping and data stream selection)
- (overall annoying to require re-setting of data mappings every time, especially for many channels)
- fullscreen button doesnt do anything
- lsl streams only recognized after the first packet is sent
